<p>During my education, one of the most surprisingly interesting courses I took was <strong>Software Evolution</strong>. I originally took it because I know the professor was great, but it turned out to be hugely inspirational and motivating in the last years.</p>

<p>During that class we didn‚Äôt study how to write code, how to write better code, or how to find bad code. We barely even talked about code at all. We talked about teams, pressure, time, and working together. It turned out, that software evolution was mostly not about the software itself, but instead it was about the people who wanted it to do things.</p>

<h1 id="evolution-relativity">Evolution Relativity</h1>

<p><strong>Left alone</strong>, forgotten in a closet, is in many ways the most stable a system can be. The sleepy log server that only ever complains when it runs out of disk space is probably the most reliable system in most clusters. Why? Management never brings feature requests for the log server. Noone ever gets a ticket ‚ÄúAdd a new chat feature to the log server,‚Äù unless you work at Google (üòâ). The system <em>evolves</em> at a very slow pace. Once in awhile someone might roll out a routine software update, but it‚Äôs rare for those kinds of systems break down.</p>

<p>At the same time, when those kinds of systems fail, they fail <em>hard</em> and they fail <em>fast</em>. The disk fails, and the team realizes they didn‚Äôt have backups. No big loss, but it turns out when the log server is down some random worker is failing, and that‚Äôs piling up billing jobs, customers can‚Äôt pay, orders don‚Äôt get processed. Someone gets called on the weekend to fix it. The log server is replaced, and a ‚Äúnew, better‚Äù system which noone really understands is installed, and it‚Äôs left to fail again eventually.</p>

<p><strong>Constantly developed</strong>, other systems evolve at a rapid page. New features are added, dependencies added or changed, components split apart, and even the occasional redesign occurs. They are systems in constant movement.</p>
