          <section class="excerpt">
              <p>Most intelligent devices existing in the physical world, a quadcopter included, take input from sensors and act on them in some way, possibly producing an output. Some sensors are digital, like a button or switch, and can be read via a digitalRead() on an Arduino, returning either HIGH or LOW. Other sensors are analog and can return anything in the range of 0-1023. These are things like potentiometers, force sensors, light sensors, and temperature sensors. Finally, some sensors use Inter-integrated Circuit (I2C) or Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) to interface. Typically these are found on more complicated chips like gyroscopes and...</p>

              <p>Lately we’ve been playing with Quadcopters a lot, one of the key components of any copter is it’s motors! I’ll be writing about motors next, but before that I wanted to share some small, short Arduino ‘labs’ that you can do either on your own or with your cohort! All of these ‘labs’ are as inexpensive as we could manage in terms of parts, with the exception of the Arduino. You’re welcome to print, distribute, and modify all of these to meet your needs. You can email me if you’d like the source files. We use Fritzing for breadboard layouts....</p>

First, let’s take a look at what yaw looks like under simple circumstances, then we’ll explain the motion. Notice how two propellers come to a stop when yawing? Understanding Torque Let’s first talk about Center of Gravity, have you ever tried to balance an object on the tip of your finger? That’s a center of gravity! Fun Fact: Your center of gravity is your belly button! The quads is, predictably, near its center. Torque () is a twisting force, you use it...</p>

              <p>Spinnning tens of thousands times a second, four rotors cut through the air with their propellors. Their motion lifts them in unison, for they are connected together. In the center of the apparatus sits a bank of sensors, processors, and a radio acting in concert to control the great flow of air passing over it. Some ways away, perhaps near, perhaps far, its pilot watches over it. Whether by program or controller, they hold the fate of the airborne being in their hands.

You can play along on http://play.rust-lang.org/ and by browsing here. This article is not a subtitute for the documentation or experience. Our First Iterator Having everything twice as much is great, right? Let’s take a set of values and double it! fn main() { // First, we get a set of values. let input = [1, 2, 3]; // Create an iterator over them. let iterator = input.iter(); // Specify things to do...</p>
