              <p>I’ve begun redesigning my website with my own theme! With school finishing and new employment looming I decided to take the time to make my site truly my own.

As a result I’ve rewritten all of the Jekyll liquid templates and styles myself and have been having a lot of fun learning how to use things like display: flexbox. I’m sure there will be bugs and people will have suggestions on how to improve things, please feel welcome to email me if you do.

              <p>Back in 2014 when I was learning about Docker I got around to making a base image for Arch Linux. It was a really fun exploration and I got to know a lot more about how Docker worked from it. I’d highly suggest trying to make your own sometime! Docker has matured a lot since, and I’ve enjoyed following it. I took some time this last week to revisit my Arch Linux image and ensure it’s still functional. I wasn’t surprised when the scripts continued to work just fine, even after two years. With nothing broken, I knew I only...</p>

(I previously just rustup‘d the newest nightly every few days.) Features Cached multirust, Rust toolchain. Caching of previous build artifacts to (potentially dramatically) speed up similar builds.
