What’s RPC? Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) are basically what they say on the box. You issue one from some client to some server and the server responds (or not!) with some response. Most protocols have some form of language-agnostic schema, not unlike SQL I suppose, which they use to describe interchange data (structs and fns). A tool is generally used to create a stub, which the programmer then architects....</p>
