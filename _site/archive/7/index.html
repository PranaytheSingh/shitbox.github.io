              <p>One common monadic structure is the Option (or Maybe in Haskell and other languages) type. This can be seen as an encapsulation type. Consider a function which may fail to produce a meaningful value for certain inputs. For example, fn main () { // Parses a string into an integer. from_str::&lt;int&gt;("4"); // A valid input. from_str::&lt;int&gt;("Potato"); // Definitely invalid. } The from_str function cannot return a meaningful value for "Potato". Rust (and many other functional languages) does not have null, so what should we return? This is where an Option type becomes useful. In our example, instead of returning an...</p>

The Consumer makes a request of the Provider using authentication through Keycloak. Workflow: User visits Consumer, gets redirected to Keycloak.

Consider the following dependency graph: With async this could be modelled like so: (function init() { async.auto({ dbConn: dbConn, schemas: [ 'dbConn', schemas ], http: http, httpMiddleware: [ 'http', httpMiddleware ], routes:...</p>
