        <p>I’m happy to introduce the first stable version of my Rust Heroku Buildpack!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just looking to get your hands dirty? Look <a href="https://github.com/Hoverbear/heroku-buildpack-rust"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The project was a really interesting learning experience about how <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> does things, on <code class="highlighter-rouge">bash</code> scripting, and about <a href="https://github.com/brson/multirust/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">multirust</code></a>, which I’d not used before but now am quite a fan of! (I previously just <code class="highlighter-rouge">rustup</code>‘d the newest nightly every few days.)</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Cached <code class="highlighter-rouge">multirust</code>, Rust toolchain.</li>
  <li>Caching of previous build artifacts to (potentially dramatically) speed up similar builds.</li>
  <li>Configurable version selection inside of the Cargo.toml.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s unit tested using Heroku’s official <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-testrunner">testrunner</a> every commit (using <a href="http://homu.io/">homu</a>) and includes a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code> which executes a docker based test locally.</p>

<h3 id="development-story">Development Story</h3>

<p>I am a huge fan of Heroku, they’re were I hosted my first web app, they are where <a href="http://gatheringourvoices.bcaafc.com/">Gathering Our Voices</a> hosted our website for two years, and I have several friends who work there. While I was in San Fransisco for our <a href="/2015/08/27/meetup/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">raft-rs</code> meetup</a> they even invited me to come visit and meet some of their team.</p>

<p>There was, however, one sore point with Heroku for me: There were no Rust buildpacks I was happy with! There was <a href="https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust">emk’s</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chrisumbel/heroku-buildpack-rust">chrisumbel’s</a> but I wasn’t particularly happy with either. There wasn’t a ton of flexibility with them and they were both only manually tested with <code class="highlighter-rouge">vagrant</code> VMs. The last update to either was in March, which was still around the time when Rust was rapidly changing and maturing. (Though, it still is, but more conservatively!)</p>

<p>Originally my plan had been to issue a PR to one of them, but by the time I started digging into how things worked I realized <strong>I wanted to make my own buildpack</strong>. So I did. At first I used <code class="highlighter-rouge">rustup</code> and tried to handle detecting when to update myself, but eventually realized <code class="highlighter-rouge">multirust</code> was a more straightforward way to go.</p>

<p>I made the mistake of starting it right before both exams and the holidays, so things went slower than I anticipated. Along the way I got to learn several neat lessons which I’ve shared below. I’m looking forward to playing more with Rust on Heroku and would some day like to see <code class="highlighter-rouge">raft-rs</code> based applications on their infrastructure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A special thanks to my friends at Heroku, Peter and Joe, for helping me work out a few kinks and showing me the test-runner (which showed me the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cedar</code> docker images as well!)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rust has no posted version strings for <code class="highlighter-rouge">nightly</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">beta</code></strong>, unlike stable which you can get the current versions with <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/channel-rust-stable</code>, you cannot use a similar method to detect for <code class="highlighter-rouge">beta</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">nightly</code>. While I was using <code class="highlighter-rouge">rustup</code> at one point I resorted to using <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl -s https://doc.rust-lang.org/$RUSTC_CHANNEL/index.html | grep -hE "class=\"hash" | grep -ohE "\w{9}"</code> to detect the version! I didn’t like that, it was dirty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Heroku doesn’t let buildpacks do anything more than applications really.</strong> Really, thinking about it, this makes sense, but I was initially really surprised that I couldn’t (easily) use tools like <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt-get</code> to fetch packages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">grep</code>’s options are vaster in number than I first realized.</strong> I love <code class="highlighter-rouge">grep</code> and use it with regexs all the time, but in my exploration I actually found some really interesting flags, including one that <code class="highlighter-rouge">null</code>s out newlines for multiline matching. Crazy stuff!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">multirust</code> doesn’t seem to allow you to configure where it puts the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.multirust</code> directory.</strong> While I tried several promising sounding flags (<code class="highlighter-rouge">--prefix</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">--destdir</code>) I didn’t find anything of the sort. I ended up just setting <code class="highlighter-rouge">$HOME</code> myself, but I don’t think this is the best idea.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
