        <p>This year helped again with Gathering Our Voices. I worked in the same capacity as previous years and had a similarly great time.</p>

<p>Rather than talking at length about events Iâ€™d rather share pictures. All of these photos were taken by my friend Geoff Howe. All images are wholly owned by the BCAAFC and you may not reproduce or use them in anything without their permission.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2016/03/gov-22-7.jpg" alt="That night there was the talent show. I was very happy to see my friend Sam performing again. Last year he performed for his first time and this year he did even better! I was so proud of all the performers!" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2016/03/gov-23-3.jpg" alt="That evening we hosted our big youth dance. One of the delegates expressed to myself and some of the other tech people that they were interested in what we did. She ended up helping out at several points throughout the week!" /></p>
