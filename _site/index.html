Sadly, time is a limited resource and I’ve been managing to keep quite busy. For now, I’ll stick to an update about a wave of change in my life. Glowing memories Over the last year and a half I’ve had the absolutely wonderful pleasure of working with my dear friends at Asquera in beautiful Berlin. It has given me ample opportunity to learn, teach, and get experience with a wide range of topics. I will carry...</p>

We can’t do it alone, but together, with hard work, we might make it. During my education, one of the most surprisingly interesting courses I took was Software Evolution. I originally took it because I know the professor was great, but it turned out to be hugely inspirational and motivating in the last years.

              <p>Modern applications often interface with external services through RESTful APIs. Examples of this include everything from telephony like Twilio to infrastructure like DigitalOcean. In most cases these services provide an HTTP REST API, though there are exceptions such as mailers which sometimes use SMTP. It’s rather common for these services to offer official wrappers for some popular programming languages, and often there are many unofficial wrappers of varying quality. Digital Ocean, for example, offers official Ruby and Go wrappers here. In languages without a wrapper, interacting with these services can involve some extra work. It can be the case that...</p>

It is a compile target for languages like C and Rust that enables us to write, and run, code from these languages in our browser. In the interest of learning more about this technology (and to avoid writing more Javascript) let’s explore together and get our hands dirty!

It’s really wonderful to start exploring a project and see familiar patterns and styles which you’ve already used before. It makes it easier to understand the project, and empowers you to start working on the project faster. Sometimes you’re working on a new project and realize that you need to do something in the same way as you did in another project.
